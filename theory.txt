when we want to store our output we can use file handling

uaing of 4 modes we can work with file


1)read:r mode: we can read file.
2)write :w mode : we can write a file
3)append:a mode: we can add content in existing file
4)x:x mode:creat a blank new file


syntax:

var=open("filename","mode")
